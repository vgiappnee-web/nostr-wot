# Nostr Web of Trust

Open infrastructure for trust-based filtering on Nostr.

## The Problem

Nostr has no central authority to filter spam or verify identity. Web of Trust solves this by measuring social distance—how many hops separate you from someone in the follow graph.

## Projects

### Browser Extension

The WoT Extension adds Web of Trust capabilities directly to your browser, exposing the `window.nostr.wot` API for any Nostr client to use.

- **Repository:** [github.com/nostr-wot/nostr-wot-extension](https://github.com/nostr-wot/nostr-wot-extension)
- **Features:** Real-time trust scoring, visual indicators, client-side filtering
- **Browsers:** Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera (Firefox coming soon)

### JavaScript SDK

The nostr-wot-sdk provides a lightweight JavaScript/TypeScript library for integrating Web of Trust directly into your applications without requiring the browser extension.

- **Repository:** [github.com/nostr-wot/nostr-wot-sdk](https://github.com/nostr-wot/nostr-wot-sdk)
- **NPM:** [npmjs.com/package/nostr-wot-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nostr-wot-sdk)
- **Features:** TypeScript support, React hooks, configurable trust scoring

### WoT Oracle

A high-performance Rust backend that maintains a real-time graph of the Nostr follow network and provides instant distance/trust queries via REST API.

- **Repository:** [github.com/nostr-wot/wot-oracle](https://github.com/nostr-wot/wot-oracle)
- **Public Instance:** `https://wot-oracle.mappingbitcoin.com`
- **Features:** Bidirectional BFS, LRU caching, <1ms cached queries, self-hostable

## How It Works

1. Your pubkey is the center
2. People you follow = 1 hop
3. People they follow = 2 hops
4. Beyond 3 hops = likely noise

## Use Cases

- Spam filtering without centralized blocklists
- Trust scores for marketplace/reviews
- Tiered notifications by social proximity
- Client-side content filtering

## API

```js
// Extension (client-side)
await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey)
await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey)

// SDK (client-side)
import { NostrWoT } from 'nostr-wot-sdk'
const wot = new NostrWoT({ userPubkey: '...' })
await wot.getTrustScore(pubkey)

// Oracle (server-side)
GET /distance?from={pubkey}&to={pubkey}
POST /distance/batch
GET /stats
```
