# Nostr Web of Trust

> Open infrastructure for trust-based filtering on Nostr. Measures social distance (hops) in the follow graph to enable spam filtering, trust scoring, and content filtering without centralized authorities.

Nostr Web of Trust (WoT) solves the spam and identity verification problem on Nostr by calculating how many hops separate users in the social follow graph. Your pubkey is the center: people you follow = 1 hop, people they follow = 2 hops, beyond 3 hops = likely noise.

## Core Concepts

- **Trust Score**: Calculated based on social distance and number of paths connecting two users
- **Distance**: Number of hops between two pubkeys in the follow graph
- **Web of Trust**: The network of follows that determines trust relationships

## Trust Score Formula

```
score = base × distance_weight × (1 + path_bonus)
```

Distance weights: 1 hop = 100%, 2 hops = 60%, 3 hops = 30%, 4+ hops = 10%

## API Reference

### Browser Extension API

```javascript
// Get distance in hops
await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(targetPubkey)

// Get trust score (0-1)
await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(targetPubkey)

// Check if user is in Web of Trust
await window.nostr.wot.isInWoT(targetPubkey)
```

### JavaScript SDK

```javascript
import { NostrWoT } from 'nostr-wot-sdk'

const wot = new NostrWoT({ userPubkey: 'your-pubkey' })
await wot.getTrustScore(targetPubkey)
await wot.getDistance(targetPubkey)
```

### Oracle REST API

```
GET /distance?from={pubkey}&to={pubkey}
POST /distance/batch
GET /stats
```
