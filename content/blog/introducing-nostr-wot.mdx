The Nostr ecosystem is growing rapidly. Every day, thousands of new users join the network, creating notes, sharing content, and building connections. But with this growth comes a familiar challenge: **how do you separate signal from noise?**

## The Problem with Open Networks

Open, permissionless networks are powerful precisely because anyone can participate. But this openness also means dealing with:

- **Spam and bot accounts** flooding your feed
- **Impersonators** pretending to be someone they're not
- **Low-quality content** drowning out valuable discussions

Traditional solutions rely on centralized moderation—a team deciding what's acceptable. But that defeats the purpose of a decentralized network.

## Enter Web of Trust

Web of Trust takes a different approach. Instead of relying on a central authority, it leverages something you already have: **your social connections**.

The concept is simple:

1. **You trust the people you follow**
2. **They trust the people they follow**
3. **Trust flows through these connections**

If someone is 1 hop away (you follow them directly), they're highly trusted. 2 hops away (a friend of a friend), somewhat trusted. 3 or more hops? Probably noise.

```javascript
// Check if someone is in your Web of Trust
const inNetwork = await window.nostr.wot.isInMyWoT(pubkey);

// Get their exact distance
const hops = await window.nostr.wot.getDistance(pubkey);

// Get a trust score (0-1)
const score = await window.nostr.wot.getTrustScore(pubkey);
```

## How It Works

Our browser extension builds a local graph of your social connections. When you visit any Nostr app, it can query this graph to determine trust levels for any pubkey.

<Callout type="tip">
The extension works with any Nostr app that implements the WoT API. No changes needed to your favorite client!

### Privacy First

We designed the system with privacy as a core principle:

- **Local Mode**: Everything stays in your browser. Zero external requests.
- **Remote Mode**: Only pubkey lookups—no content, no tracking.
- **Hybrid Mode**: Best of both worlds with caching.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. We're working on:

- **SDK for developers** to integrate WoT into their apps
- **Oracle server** for apps that can't run client-side computations
- **Advanced scoring** with mutual follows and bridging bonuses

## Get Started
