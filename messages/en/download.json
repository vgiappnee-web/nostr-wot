      "whatIsWot": {
        "question": "What is Web of Trust?",
        "answer": "Web of Trust measures social distance—how many 'hops' separate you from another user in the Nostr follow graph. If you follow someone, they're 1 hop away. If they follow someone else, that person is 2 hops from you. This helps filter spam and verify reputation without centralized blocklists."
      },
      "howExtensionWorks": {
        "question": "How does the extension work?",
        "answer": "The extension exposes a window.nostr.wot API that any website can use to query trust distances. When a Nostr client wants to know if a user is trustworthy, it asks the extension for the hop count. The extension can calculate this locally or query our Oracle API for faster results."
      },
      "isDataPrivate": {
        "question": "Is my data private?",
        "answer": "Yes. In Local mode, all calculations happen in your browser using IndexedDB—nothing leaves your device. In Remote mode, queries go to the Oracle API which sees the pubkeys you're checking but doesn't track or log them. You can also self-host the Oracle for complete control."
      },
      "supportedBrowsers": {
        "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
        "answer": "The extension works on all Chromium-based browsers: Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Opera. Firefox support is planned for a future release."
      },
      "nostrAccount": {
        "question": "Do I need a Nostr account?",
        "answer": "Yes, you need a Nostr pubkey to use the extension. The extension uses your pubkey to calculate social distances from your position in the follow graph. You don't need to provide your private key—only your public key."
      },
      "isFree": {
        "question": "Is it free?",
        "answer": "Yes, completely free and open source under the MIT license. The extension, Oracle API, and all source code are available on GitHub."
